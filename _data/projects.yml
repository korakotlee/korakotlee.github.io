  about: |
    <a href="https://federalist.18f.gov">Federalist</a> is a static site platform for compliantly hosting federal web sites.
    It greatly reduces the arduous compliance burden of federal offices that want to launch web sites, which saves
    a large amount of staff time and resources for those offices. Federalist hosts over 100 sites and completes over 1,000 builds per week.
    <br/>
    I am currently the engineering lead on this project, building upon the great work of previous 18F developers.
